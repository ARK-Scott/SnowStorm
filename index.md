### Discord
Please understand that we use Discord for communication, so join our chat by [clicking here](https://discord.gg/g9z5tXm). Discord does not require you to have a microphone.

### Friendly Reminders

1) Bring a spyglass with you at all times, and if you don't have a spyglass make one. Don't know how to make one, or don't have enough engram points to unlock it, ask Dreamer, Ember, or Scott. Just please bring a spyglass, because it gets really annoying when we have to lend our spyglasses and stop what we are doing.

2) If you need something made and you can't make it, or you don't have a blueprint, then please ask.

3) Vaults and Bases that are locked, unaccessable to the regular tribe member, are only to keep things safe. We don't do that to horde all of the good stuff for ourselves, so if you ever need something ask!

4) All members, new or past, are not allowed to build anymore bases. We have reached the server limit of three, and we ask that you don't build without talking to Ember first. (Failure to comply with this will result in a staff member coming and destroying the base).

5) Please try to tame dinosaurs over level one hundred (100), if possible. All dinosaurs over one hundred (100) **must** be added to the Google Spreadsheet. If you are unable/don't wish to update the spreadsheet, then please tell Ember, Dreamer, or Scott. [Click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K3qWOMzMR2gh14w_26vfcTmlIenON87lT7LqfCHUqTA/edit#gid=0) to access the SnowStorm Breeding List.

### Rules

1) Respect Ember and Dreamer - If they tell you to do something, then do it.

2) Respect fellow tribe members - This includes dinosaurs and personal items. Don't be rude and paint innapropriate things on people.

3) Follow the server rules. We will not be punished for your mistakes, so read the rules. [Click me](http://rehabgaming-usa.enjin.com/arkrules) for the server rules.

4) Do not go around killing players' dinosaurs, raiding, or killing players - We don't want to be raided, because of something that you did.

5) No stealing of your own tribe mates- This is self-explanatory

6) No breeding any tames without permission from Dreamer, Ember, or the person's tame you are breeding with.

7) Don't go AFK in the base for more than five minutes; if you need to go AFK, then leave the server. 

  AFK means that you are not near your keyboard, hence the phrase "Away From Keyboard"
  
8) Do not use anyother player's dinosaur without permission from the owner.

  If you by accidentally kill another player's dinosaur, then you have to replace it (at the level it was tamed).
  
9) Do not demolish stuff that isn't yours - this applies to ranks that have permission to demolish things.

10) Do not use materials, if you do not intend to replace them.

11) Don't just sit around the base all day doing nothing, do something productive.

### Consequences

Due to the fact that all of the rules are enforced differently, there are different consequences. You will almost always start off with a warning, unless you do something really bad. If you disobey orders given from high ranked staff (e.g. Ember and/or Dreamer), you will *probably* be kicked from the tribe. Please contact a staff member, if you have any questions.

### Conclusion

Thanks for making it this far! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask Ember, Dreamer, or Scott in the discord chat. Don't have Discord? Click the link at the top of the page to the tribe chat and/or send us a message on the server (in tribe chat, please). If you contact us on Steam, we will not know who you are. Once again, thanks for reading this entire page! Enjoy playing :)
